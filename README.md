# MOswap 
MoSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) developed using a suite of modern technologies including React, JavaScript, and Node.js. This DEX provides a simple yet effective swap functionality, allowing users to exchange different types of tokens.

The application leverages the Web3 API to obtain real-time token prices, and the 1inch API aggregator is used to facilitate token swaps. The Wagmi Web3 library is integrated to connect users' wallets with the DApp, ensuring secure transactions.

The user interface of the DApp is created with React, offering a responsive and intuitive user experience. On the server-side, a Node.js Express app is used, providing a robust and scalable infrastructure for the DEX.

In summary, MoSwap is a well-rounded project that harnesses the power of blockchain technology to offer a secure and efficient platform for token swaps. Despite not being hosted on GitHub, it showcases a strong understanding of DEX development and blockchain technologies.
